This post will show examples of embedding interactive charts produced using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) and [Hvplot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/).

## Altair Example

Below is a chart of the incidence of measles since 1928 for the 50 US states.

<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>

This was produced using Altair and embedded in this static web page. Note that you can also display Python code on this page:

```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('notebook')
```

## HvPlot Example

Lastly, the measles incidence produced using the HvPlot package:

<div id="hv-chart-1"></div>

## Notes

- See the [lecture 13A slides](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/week-13/blob/master/lecture-13A.ipynb) for the code that produced these plots.
