In order to anlayze the the impact of WASH on child health, this post shows how clustering analysis helps us understand the situations in different countries and how prediction models help us predict child mortality based on drinking water sources, sanitation, and vaccination.

## Clustering

Firstly, .

### Number of clusters


### k=2 vs k=3

</p>




## Prediction Models

### Feature selection


### Modeling

### Best model: Random forest

## Notes

- See the [lecture 13A slides](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/week-13/blob/master/lecture-13A.ipynb) for the code that produced these plots.
